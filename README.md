Based on the late mathematician John Conway's 'Game of Life', this app adheres to the following rules:

###
For a space that is populated:

1. Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.

2. Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

3. Each cell with two or three neightbors survives.

###
For a space that is empty or unpopulated:

1. Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
